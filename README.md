Project Overview
Title: Fine-tuning Multiclassification 13 Cancer Symtoms
Description: This study introduces Symptom-BERT, a pre-trained language model designed to improve the identification of cancer symptoms from clinical notes. Our findings suggest that Symptom-BERT outperforms existing BERT models in this task. The development represents a promising healthcare direction for AI, potentially enhancing patient symptom management and self-care outcomes.
